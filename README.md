# Banking-Analysis

Group project aimed at developing an effective telemarketing strategy to sell term deposit accounts for a Portuguese bank. This bank has been conducting marketing campaigns, but it has not been effective. Our goal then was to develop an effective marketing strategy by using machine learning and to collect correlated attributes to increase the possibility to get more subscriptions.
