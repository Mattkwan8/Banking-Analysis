# Banking-Analysis

This project focused on developing an optimized telemarketing strategy to boost term deposit subscriptions for a Portuguese bank. Despite previous marketing campaigns, the bank struggled with low conversion rates. Our objective was to leverage machine learning to identify key customer attributes correlated with successful conversions and to create a more targeted, data-driven marketing approach. By analyzing historical data, we aimed to enhance customer engagement and maximize subscription rates for term deposits.
